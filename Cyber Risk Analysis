Security and Risk Management
Considering a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
Confidentiality: Use encryption to protect data transmitted between the ATM and the bank’s server. Implement multifactor authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access account information.
Integrity: Utilize hashing algorithms to ensure data is not altered during transmission. Implement software integrity checks to ensure that the ATM software has not been tampered with.
Availability: Maintain redundant backups and a disaster recovery plan to ensure the ATM is available even in case of failures. Implement continuous monitoring and preventive maintenance to minimize downtime.
2. Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
Separation of Duties: Ensure different people have distinct responsibilities to prevent abuse of power and fraud.
Least Privilege: Ensure users only have the access necessary to perform their functions, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Encryption: Use encryption to protect data in transit and at rest, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the information.
3. What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?
Risk Assessment: Identify and evaluate assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. Main objective: understand the risks and their magnitude.
Risk Analysis: Evaluate the identified risks qualitatively and quantitatively. Main objective: prioritize the risks and assign monetary values for informed decision-making.
Risk Mitigation: Implement measures to reduce, transfer, or accept risks. Main objective: decrease the probability and impact of identified risks.
