Data Protection: Data In transit vs. Data At Rest
From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.

Data at Rest:
Personal documents stored on your computer.
Photos saved on your smartphone or in a cloud storage service
Data from your banking app, stored locally on the device until it's sent or updated.
Data in Transit:
Sending an email to a colleague.
Uploading a document to Google Drive or Dropbox.
Accessing your online bank account through a web browser.

Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.

Confidentiality: Encryption ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access the data.
Integrity: Tools associated with encryption, such as digital signatures, ensure that data has not been altered during storage or transmission.
Availability: Encryption should be implemented in a way that does not hinder the ability of authorized users to access the data, avoiding scenarios where data becomes inaccessible due to lost keys or system failures.
